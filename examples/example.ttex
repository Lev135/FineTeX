@Import "examples/std.ttex"

% That was a block of definitions. It should be the first environment in file
% By this moment there is no way to import definitions from other file
% so we have to declare all base environments and commands in every file separately

% Note, that there are no comments in .ttex format by this moment. 
% These comments are just a paragraph, that will be translated in .tex file 
% (and then removed during the compilation of .pdf file)
% As a consequence we can't use comments in @Define environment and 
% in other places, except those in which paragraphs are allowed.
% In addition, you cannot use back quotes in them, since they will be parsed
% as an inline math expression.

% By now we should add \documentclass and \usepackage commands
% also as a plain text
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,oneside]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}


@Document
  % Everything here (2 spaces-indented) will be in \begin{document} .. \end{document}
  % Indentation must be exactly 2 spaces

  This is a simple paragraph
  Which continues at the next line

  And this is the next paragraph
  
  \section{lists} 
  % By this moment there is no way to take arguments in environment,
  % so we use a paragraph with TeX command here to start a section
  @Prefs style is very useful for items. 
  Note that prefs should be indented more then surrounding paragraphs
    - enumerate (this text is in paragraph inside an item):
        # one (it should be more indented then paragraph)
        # two
        # three
    - itemize:
        - one
        - two
        - three

  Consecutive elements of the list are framed by the itemize/enumerate environment,
  if there is no empty lines between them. So:
    # one
    # two
    # three

    # one again
    # two
  
  \section{Math}
  Inline math can be inserted in paragraph in back quotes: `a + b = c` 
  --- this is inline math

  Fore block math @Prefs syntax is used: 
    > a + b = c 
  Next lines will be framed by align* environment and \verb.\\. 
  will be added between them automatically
    > a + b     &= c
    > (a + b)^2 &= d

    > a + b + c &= 0
  Note that the last equation will framed by separate align*, because
  there is an empty line before it. 

  To be continued...
