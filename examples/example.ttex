@Import "examples/std.ttex"

    <>           =  "\\Diamond" 
    []           =  "\\Box"

% That were blocks (environments) of definitions and imports. 
% They should be in front of all the contents of the file
% Only definitions are imported from the file  

% Note, that there are no comments in .ttex format by this moment. 
% These comments are just a paragraph, that will be translated in .tex file 
% (and then removed during the compilation of .pdf file)
% As a consequence we can't use comments in @Define environment and 
% in other places, except those in which paragraphs are allowed.

% By now we should add \documentclass and \usepackage commands
% also as a plain text
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,oneside]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}


@Document
  % Everything here (2 spaces-indented) will be in \begin{document} .. \end{document}
  % Indentation must be exactly 2 spaces

  This is a simple paragraph
  Which continues at the next line

  And this is the next paragraph

  @Section "Lists" 
    {}@Prefs style is very useful for items.
    % Figure brackets line above are inserted to prevent parsing @Prefs as beginning of environment 
    Note that prefs should be indented more then surrounding paragraphs
      - enumerate (this text is in paragraph inside an item):
          # one (it should be more indented then paragraph)
          # two
          # three
      - itemize:
          - one
          - two
          - three

    Consecutive elements of the list are framed by the itemize/enumerate environment,
    if there is no empty lines between them. So:
      # one
      # two
      # three

      # one again
      # two
  
  @Section "Math"
    Inline math can be inserted in paragraph in back quotes: `a + b = c` 
    --- this is inline math

    For block math @Prefs syntax is used: 
      > a + b = c 
    Next lines will be framed by align* environment and \verb.\\. 
    % \verb is used here to escape LaTeX compilation errors 
    will be added between them automatically
      > a + b     &= c
      > (a + b)^2 &= d

      > a + b + c &= 0
    Note that the last equation will framed by separate align*, because
    there is an empty line before it. 

  To be continued...
