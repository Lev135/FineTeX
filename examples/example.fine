  @Section "Basics"
    Basic elements of these language are Paragraphs, Environments and Prefs

    @Subsection "Paragraphs"
      Paragraphs here, as well as in TeX are separated by empty lines:   
      
      This is a simple paragraph
      Which continues at the next line

      And this is the next paragraph
    
    @Subsection "Environments"
    
    @Subsection "Prefs"


  @Section "Lists" 
    \texttt{@Prefs} style is very useful for items.
    Note that prefs should be indented more then surrounding paragraphs
      - enumerate (this text is in paragraph inside an item
        so it can be continued on the next line):
          # one (it should be more indented then paragraph)
          # two
          # three
      - itemize:
          - one
          - two
          - three

    Consecutive elements of the list are framed by the itemize/enumerate environment,
    iff there are no empty lines between them. So:
      # one
      # two
      # three

      # one again
      # two
  
  @Section "Math"
    Inline math can be inserted in paragraph in back quotes: `a + b = c` 
    --- this is inline math

    For block math \texttt{@Prefs} syntax is used: 
      > a + b = c 
    Next lines will be framed by align* environment and \verb.\\.%
    % \verb is used here to escape LaTeX compilation errors 
    % '%' two lines above is to prevent splitting paragraph on two parts by this comment
    will be added between them automatically
      > a + b     &= c
      > (a + b)^2 &= d

      > a + b + c &= 0
    Note that the last equation will framed by separate align*, because
    there is an empty line before it. 

  To be continued...
