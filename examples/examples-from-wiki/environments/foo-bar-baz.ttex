@Define
  @Environments
    Foo     = @TexBeginEnd "foo"
    Bar     = @Begin       "\\textit{This is a bar:}"
    Baz     = @End         "\\textit{That was baz...}"

@Foo
  some text in foo
  @Bar
    bar in foo
    @Baz
      Baz in bar
    in bar, but not in baz
  in foo....

  And this is also in foo
But now outside all environments.
